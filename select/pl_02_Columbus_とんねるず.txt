Better keep your distance
from this whale
Better keep your boat
from going astray
Find yourself a partner
and treat them well
Try to give them shelter,
night and day
'Cause here in this blue light
Far away from the fireside
Things can get twisted
and crazy and crowded
And you can't even feel alright
So, I dream of Columbus
Every time the panic starts
You dream of Columbus
With your maps
and your beautiful charts
You dream of Columbus
With an ache
in your traveling heart
See how the cormorant swoops
and dives
Must be some thrill to go
that deep
Down to the basement of
this life
Down to where the mermaids
gently sleep
Not like here in this blue light
Far away from the fireside
Where things can get twisted
and haunted and crowded
You can't even feel alright
So, you dream of Columbus
Every time the panic starts
You dream of Columbus
With your maps
and your beautiful charts
You dream of Columbus
And as the tide must ebb
and flow
I am dragged down under
And I wait the livelong day
For an end to my hunger
So, I dream of Columbus
Every time the panic starts
I dream of Columbus
With my maps
and my beautiful charts
I dream of Columbus
And there's peace
in this traveling heart
Dream of Columbus
I dream of Columbus
Dream of Columbus
Dream of Columbus
